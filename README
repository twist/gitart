	GITART.pl
	------


Recently i have read something about "ssh random art" and quite liked the id. 
The next thought was "what else uses hashes for fingerprinting something?", "git!".
so here it is. git | random | art > do_some_art.


Installation
------------
Drop all of the files in src to your ~/bin, and,
a) if you have a vannila post-commit-hook replace it with the delivered one or
b) if you have a custom post-comit-hook append the content of the delivered one to it. 

thats it.
Happy Commiting!



Example:
--------


twist@some-host:~/projects/some_git_repo> git commit 
+-----gitart------+
|          . .    |
|         .   .   |
|        . . . . .|
|     . . . o . + |
|      + . o   + =|
|     o o =     o |
|= .   + o o     .|
| =   . o +       |
|+ . . o +        |
